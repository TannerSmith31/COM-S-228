This is the third homework project I did in COM S 228 in the Fall of 2022. It is an implementation of an iterator to be used on a weird list that is like a combination
of an array list and linked list wherin each node (doubly linked) is an evenly sized array. The "stoutListMain" is a file where I would run my stoutList on different
lists; kinda like a test workspace.
