This is the fourth homework project I made in COM S 228 in the Fall of 2022. It is a program that takes .arch files of a certain format and, using the decoder string,
creates a binary tree structured decoder and decodes the cipher text in the file. A few .arch files are provided in this folder to show what they look like.
